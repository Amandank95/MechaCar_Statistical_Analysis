# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

### Linear Regression

- Vehicle length and ground clearance would provide a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The p-value of the summary is 5.35e-11, which is lower than the assumed significance level, so we would reject the null hypothesis.
- The linear model seemingly effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar protoypes because the Multple R squared value equates to about 71%.

### Suspension Coil Summary
